# Anime-Score-Predictor
This app has a lot of requirements, install them with requirements.txt
This app is currently funtional however requires training as github does not allow me to upload the saved model parameters (file is too large)
Once model is trained and parameters are saved as a .pth file you are ready to go, just make sure predictanime.py points to the same file
run app.py and go to localhost:5000
